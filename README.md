# CODSOFT - Task 1 - IRIS Flower Classification
This repository contains the IRIS Flower Classification project developed by Suvranil Saha for a data science internship at CodSoft. The project involves clustering and visualization of the Iris dataset using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Description

The IRIS Flower Classification project classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset. The project demonstrates the use of clustering algorithms, particularly K-Means, and various visualization techniques to analyze the data.

## Code and Data

### Code

The main code is contained in the [IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb](https://github.com/sensiboi/CODSOFT-Task-1/blob/main/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb). It includes the following steps:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Checking for Null Values
5. 3D Scatter Plot
6. 2D Scatter Plot
7. Applying Elbow Technique
8. K-Means Algorithm
9. Confusion Matrix

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:
- sepal_length
- sepal_width
- petal_length
- petal_width
- species
